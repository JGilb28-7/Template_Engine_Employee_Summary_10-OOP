#### Notes
Intial concept was to create the app.js I start by developing multiple functions for each emplpoyee role however that didnt allow me to move past the manager role - I attempted to create a switch function which again presented the list however due to error in code it was running and stopping not allowing for input or would only input the manager role.  I was able to keep my intial code however after examining online solutions I found my error - my intial function were good and my question correct - i did create the intial question as a const to call in the manager function. 

I refered to and reference code from hoffman1200 via github found via google.

I started the project by creating and building out the classes & construtors in the lib file allowing - using the class videos as a resource and the cource work from that week.  I was able to successful test - which I felt was the biggest win for me with this project.

I created the output file by combining the templates into one file.
